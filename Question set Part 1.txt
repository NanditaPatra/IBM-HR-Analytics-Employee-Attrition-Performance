Certainly! Here are some sample SQL project questions based on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset:

1. **Basic Queries:**
   - How many records are there in the dataset?
      --SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE;
      --1470

   - What are the different columns available in the dataset?
       
   - Retrieve the first 10 records from the dataset.
     --SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
       LIMIT 10;

   - Show the number of employees who have left the company (Attrition = 'Yes').
      --SELECT COUNT(*) FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE ATTRITION = "YES";

2. **Data Exploration:**
   - What is the average age of employees in the company?
      --SELECT ROUND(AVG(AGE),2) AS AVG_AGE
        FROM EMPLOYEE;
      --36.92

   - How many employees are in each department?
      --SELECT COUNT(*) AS NO_OF_EMPLOYEES, DEPARTMENT
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
        ORDER BY NO_OF_EMPLOYEES DESC;

   - What is the distribution of employees across different education fields (EducationField)?
      --SELECT COUNT(*) AS NO_OF_EMPLOYEES, EDUCATIONFIELD
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY EDUCATIONFIELD
        ORDER BY NO_OF_EMPLOYEES DESC;

   - How many years on an average has the employee spent at the company (YearsAtCompany) within different departments?
      --SELECT ROUND(AVG(YEARSATCOMPANY),2) AS AVG_YEARS, DEPARTMENT
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

3. **Employee Performance:**
   - Calculate the average monthly income (MonthlyIncome) of employees of each department for each level.
      --SELECT T1.DEPARTMENT, T1.JOBLEVEL, T1.AVG_MONTHLY_INCOME
        FROM (SELECT DEPARTMENT,JOBLEVEL, ROUND(AVG(MONTHLYINCOME),2) AS AVG_MONTHLY_INCOME, 
                     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY DEPARTMENT ORDER BY JOBLEVEL ASC) AS ROWNO
              FROM EMPLOYEE
              GROUP BY DEPARTMENT, JOBLEVEL) AS T1;

   - Determine the average number of years since last promotion (YearsSinceLastPromotion) within each department.
      --SELECT DEPARTMENT, ROUND(AVG(YEARSSINCELASTPROMOTION),2) AS AVG_YEARS_SINCE_LAST_PROMOTION
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

   - Find the maximum and minimum years of experience (TotalWorkingYears) employees have.
      --SELECT MAX(TOTALWORKINGYEARS) AS MAX_YEAR_OF_EXPERIENCE, MIN(TOTALWORKINGYEARS) AS MIN_YEAR_OF_EXPERIENCE
        FROM EMPLOYEE;

4. **Attrition Analysis:**
   - How many employees have left the company per department?
      --SELECT DEPARTMENT, COUNT(*) AS EMPLOYEE_COUNT_LEFT
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE ATTRITION = "YES"
        GROUP BY DEPARTMENT;

   - What is the average monthly income of employees who have stayed vs. those who have left?
      --SELECT ATTRITION, ROUND(AVG(MONTHLYINCOME),2) AS AVG_MONTHLY_INCOME
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY ATTRITION;

   - Compare the average job satisfaction level (JobSatisfaction) between employees who have stayed and those who have left.
      --SELECT ATTRITION, ROUND(AVG(JOBSATISFACTION),2) AS AVG_MONTHLY_INCOME
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY ATTRITION;

5. **Advanced Queries:**
   - Identify the department with the highest average hourly rate (HourlyRate).
      --SELECT DEPARTMENT, ROUND(AVG(HOURLYRATE),2) AS AVG_HOURLY_RATE
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        GROUP BY DEPARTMENT
        ORDER BY AVG_HOURLY_RATE DESC
        LIMIT 1;

   - Calculate the turnover rate (percentage of employees who have left) for each job role (JobRole).
      --SELECT T3.JOBROLE, CONCAT(ROUND(((T3.EMP_LEFT_COUNT/T3.EMPLOYEE_COUNT)*100),2),"%") AS EMP_TURNOVER_RATE
        FROM (WITH T1 AS (SELECT JOBROLE, COUNT(*) AS EMPLOYEE_COUNT
                          FROM EMPLOYEE
	                  GROUP BY JOBROLE),
                   T2 AS (SELECT JOBROLE, COUNT(*) AS EMP_LEFT_COUNT
	                  FROM EMPLOYEE
                          WHERE ATTRITION = "YES"
	                  GROUP BY JOBROLE)
               SELECT T1.JOBROLE, EMPLOYEE_COUNT, EMP_LEFT_COUNT
               FROM T1
               JOIN T2
                 ON T1.JOBROLE = T2.JOBROLE) AS T3;

   - Find the employees who have been with the company for more than 10 years and have a high job satisfaction level (JobSatisfaction > 3).
      --SELECT EMPLOYEENUMBER, YEARSATCOMPANY
        FROM EMPLOYEE
        WHERE YEARSATCOMPANY >10 AND JOBSATISFACTION >3
        ORDER BY YEARSATCOMPANY DESC;

6. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Determine if there is a correlation between job satisfaction (JobSatisfaction) and monthly income (MonthlyIncome).
       --



   - Investigate whether employees who have more years of experience (TotalWorkingYears) tend to have higher job satisfaction.
   - Check if employees with a higher performance rating (PerformanceRating) tend to have lower attrition rates.

These questions cover a range of SQL operations including basic queries, data exploration, aggregation, filtering, and correlation analysis, which are typical in SQL projects analyzing HR datasets like the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset.
